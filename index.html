						<p><strong>Competition Results for 2020 are online. Bots will follow next week.</strong></p>

						<p><strong>Please always make sure to download the latest version of the competition framework.</strong></p>

						<p>The collectible online card game Hearthstone features a rich testbed and poses unique demands for generating 
							artificial intelligence agents. The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, using constructed 
							decks of thirty cards along with a selected hero with a unique power. Players use their limited mana crystals 
							to cast spells or summon minions to attack their opponent, with the goal to reduce the opponent’s health to zero. 
							The competition aims to promote the stepwise development of fully autonomous AI agents in the context of Hearthstone.</p>

						<p>Entrants will submit agents to participate in one of the two tracks:</p>

						<ul>
						<li><strong>Premade Deck Playing”-track</strong>: participants will receive a list of six known decks and 
							three decks unknown prior to your submission. During the evaluation, we will simulate all possible 
							matchups for at least 100 games to determine the average win-rate for each agent. Determining and using 
							the characteristics of the player’s and the opponent’s deck to the player’s advantage will help in winning 
							the game. The following decks will be known in advance (please check their definition in „core-extensions\SabberStoneBasicAI\src\Meta\Decks.cs“)
							<ul>
								<li>Aggro Pirate Warrior, Midrange Jade Shaman, Reno Kazakus Mage, Midrange Buff Paladin, Miracle Pirate Rogue, Zoo Discard Warlock</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>“User Created Deck Playing”-track</strong>: the competition framework allows agents to define their own deck. Finding a deck that can consistently beat a vast amount of other decks will play a key role in this competition track. Additionally, it gives the participants the chance in optimizing the agents’ strategy to the characteristics of their chosen deck</li>
						</ul>

						<div>As long as the number of submissions remains below 32, we will use a round-robin tournament to determine 
							the best submissions based on their average win-rate. In case more agents are submitted we will use multiple 
							smaller round-robin tournaments to determine likely candidates and use a final round-robin tournament for 
							determining the best three submissions.</div>
						<div></div>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
						<div>To take part in the competition you can send us your agent as .cs file or, in case multiple files 
							are required, a zip archive or a download link via <a href="mailto:alexander.dockhorn@ovgu.de">e-mail</a>. 
							The total file size should not be larger than 1 GB and all bots need to satisfy all requirements stated 
							on the <a href="https://dockhorn.antares.uberspace.de/wordpress/results/">rules</a> subpage.
							Multiple bots can be submitted, but please indicate if a submission should replace an old submission 
							or be counted as a new submission. Each participant can have up to 2 final submissions per track.
							Please be aware that submitted agents are going to be published on this website after the competition 
							finished. With the submission to this competition, you agree with this procedure.</div>
